# Test 1

## Code revision c462831f0d157a7bedfe09e481e8e02cbfbccb3d

This test run was successfully conducted on September 19, 2015.

We progressed to slightly above 8,000 ft AGL in the plane. The plane leveled out at various altitudes during the ascent.

I stayed with the plane for the descent. The trigger rate and altitude was modified for the test in the plane (instead of a human body in freefall).

Interesting to note were the triggers at takeoff.
